## Goal
This project aims to build a 3D painting robot, including the path planning, robot control, forward and inverse kinematics.
### The first version
The first version was uploaded on May 30, 2024.
The project contains three `python` files: `Arm.py`, `ArmControl.py`,`gen_path.py`.

`Arm.py`: this code involves the robot parameters like DH table and kinematic parameters.

`ArmControl.py`: this code contains necessary class and functions to control the KINOVA Gen3 Lite robot.

`gen_path.py`: generating 3D plot paths.
